## Shellshock Exploit (CVE-2014-6271)
The **Shellshock exploit** is a critical vulnerability in the Bash shell that affected many Unix-based systems, including those running Apache with CGI (Common Gateway Interface). Known as **CVE-2014-6271**, this flaw allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable systems.
### Requirements 

- **Vulnerable Bash Version**:  
  The target system must have a vulnerable version of Bash installed (prior to patched release in 2014)
- **Access to Bash Execution**:  
  The system must be configured to allow execution of Bash scripts. This could be through a web server, SSH, or other services that utilize Bash to process commands.

- **Environment Variable Handling**:  
  Exploitation requires an application or service that passes environment variables to Bash. The vulnerability is triggered when Bash incorrectly processes these variables, allowing the execution of injected commands.

- **Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Scripts**:  
  Apache or other web servers running CGI scripts are particularly vulnerable, especially when these scripts are written in or utilize Bash. The web server must be configured to handle requests that pass environment variables to Bash.
  - Look for .sh files in /cgi-bin/

- **Network Accessibility**:  
  The target must be accessible over the network, typically via HTTP/S or another service that invokes Bash, such as SSH or Telnet. An attacker needs the ability to send requests or commands to the system.

- **Ability to Inject Malicious Input**:  
  The attacker must be able to send specially crafted input, such as HTTP headers (`User-Agent`, `Referer`, `Cookie`), which are processed by the vulnerable application and passed to Bash.

### How Shellshock Works
#### Vulnerability in Bash
- Bash mishandled environment variables, allowing function definitions to include and execute additional arbitrary commands.

#### Impact on Apache CGI Scripts
- Apache CGI scripts, often using Bash, process environment variables passed from HTTP requests.
- Attackers could inject malicious code into these variables via specially crafted HTTP headers.

### Test malicious header:
```bash
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo "Shellshock Vulnerable"' http://IP/cgi-bin/FILE
```
### Exploitation Mechanism
Metasploit: exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
- RHOST
- TARGETURI

# Microsoft IIS 
## Microsoft IIS WebDav ScStoragePathFromUrl Overflow (CVE-2017-7269)
### Nickname: Explodingcan
Buffer overflow in the ScStoragePathFromUrl function in the WebDAV service in Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long header beginning with "If: <http://" in a PROPFIND request
### Requirements
- IIS 6.0
- Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 x86
### Exploitation using Metasploit
```bash
use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl
```
