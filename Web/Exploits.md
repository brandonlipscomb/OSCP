# Apache 
## Shellshock Exploit (CVE-2014-6271)

The **Shellshock exploit** is a critical vulnerability in the Bash shell that affected many Unix-based systems, including those running Apache with CGI (Common Gateway Interface). Known as **CVE-2014-6271**, this flaw allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable systems.

### How Shellshock Works

#### Vulnerability in Bash
- Bash mishandled environment variables, allowing function definitions to include and execute additional arbitrary commands.

#### Impact on Apache CGI Scripts
- Apache CGI scripts, often using Bash, process environment variables passed from HTTP requests.
- Attackers could inject malicious code into these variables via specially crafted HTTP headers.

#### Test malicious header:
```bash
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo "Shellshock Vulnerable"' http://IP/cgi-bin/FILE
```
#### Exploitation Mechanism
Metasploit: exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
- RHOST
- TARGETURI
