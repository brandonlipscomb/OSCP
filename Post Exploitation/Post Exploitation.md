# Socket Enumeration
Socket statistics (ss) can be used to check for ports listening on a given machine
- \-l: Display only listening sockets
- \-t: Display TCP sockets
- \-n: Do not try to resolve service names

**Check if there are any services listening to the local host only:**

Port:
```bash
ss -tln
```
Service:
```bash
ss -tl
```

# Tunneling 
In computer networks, a tunneling protocol is a communication protocol which allows for 
the movement of data from one network to another, by exploiting encapsulation. It 
involves allowing private network communications to be sent across a public network 
(such as the Internet) through a process called encapsulation.

The tunneling protocol works by using the data portion of a packet (the payload) to carry the packets that actually provide the service. Tunneling uses a layered protocol model such as those of the OSI or TCP/IP protocol suite, but usually violates the layering when using the payload to carry a service not normally provided by the network. Typically, the delivery protocol operates at an equal or higher level in the layered model than the payload protocol. [^1]
## Local Port Forwarding 
A separate tunnel is created inside the existing valid SSH session that forwards network 
traffic from a local port on the client's machine over to the remote server's port. 
- Under the hood, SSH allocates a socket listener on the client on the given port. When a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the existing SSH session over to the remote server's port. [^2]
```bash
 ssh -L <LOCAL_PORT>:localhost:<REMOTE_PORT> <USER>@<HOST>
```
- The above command will forward traffic from the specified local port, <LOCAL_PORT>, to the remote server's localhost interface on port, <REMOTE_PORT>
